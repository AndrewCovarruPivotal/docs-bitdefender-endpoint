[Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

**The overview describes the service that your product offers to PCF developers. 
Make sure to overview the features of the integration.
Don't focus only on the overview of your product that is being integrated.
See below for an example.**

The Apigee Edge Service Broker for PCF registers a service broker with PCF and exposes its service plans on the 
Marketplace. Developers can then create service plan instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command 
Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to their apps.

Creating an Apigee Edge for PCF service instance and binding it to an app creates an Apigee Edge API proxy that 
handles requests for the app. This lets developers use the Apigee Edge management console to manage API request 
handling between clients and the app.

**Note**: This overview will appear under **OVERVIEW**, combined with the description above in the tile's listing on
